# Day 1 Reflection: LiveEventOps Project Setup

## Date
October 6, 2025

## Summary of Work Completed

### Project Scaffolding
- ✅ Created comprehensive folder structure for LiveEventOps project
- ✅ Established directories for: `docs`, `terraform`, `bicep`, `monitoring`, `security`, `ci_cd`, `.github/workflows`, `media`
- ✅ Added initial `.gitignore` with relevant exclusions for Node.js, Python, Terraform, and media files

### Documentation & Use Cases
- ✅ Developed comprehensive README.md covering:
  - Manual event IT setup challenges (APs, cameras, PoE, printers)
  - Business value proposition for Azure automation
  - CI/CD benefits with GitHub Actions
  - Detailed Azure architecture overview
  - Technology stack and project structure

### Architecture Design
- ✅ Defined Azure resource group organization strategy
- ✅ Designed virtual network architecture with hub-spoke topology
- ✅ Planned device virtualization approach (cameras, APs, switches as VMs)
- ✅ Outlined CI/CD pipeline workflows for infrastructure and configuration deployment

### Pipeline & Integration Planning
- ✅ Documented GitHub Actions workflow strategies
- ✅ Planned Azure Monitor integration and incident response automation
- ✅ Designed secret management strategy with Azure Key Vault
- ✅ Created monitoring dashboard integration specifications

## Key Technical Decisions

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Decision**: Use both Terraform and Azure Bicep for infrastructure deployment
- **Rationale**: Terraform for multi-cloud flexibility, Bicep for Azure-native optimizations
- **Impact**: Enables comparison of IaC approaches and demonstrates best practices

### Azure Architecture
- **Decision**: Hub-spoke network topology with subnet segmentation
- **Rationale**: Provides security isolation while maintaining centralized management
- **Impact**: Scalable architecture that mirrors real-world event network requirements

### CI/CD Strategy
- **Decision**: GitHub Actions for automation with Azure DevOps integration
- **Rationale**: Native GitHub integration with enterprise-grade Azure DevOps capabilities
- **Impact**: Demonstrates modern DevOps practices for event infrastructure management

### Device Virtualization
- **Decision**: Represent physical devices (cameras, APs) as Azure VMs
- **Rationale**: Enables realistic testing and automation without physical hardware dependency
- **Impact**: Cost-effective development and testing environment for event scenarios

## Challenges Identified

### Complexity Management
- Challenge: Balancing comprehensive documentation with actionable implementation
- Approach: Structured documentation with clear implementation phases

### Real-World Simulation
- Challenge: Accurately simulating physical event constraints in cloud environment
- Approach: VM-based device simulation with realistic network topologies

### Cost Optimization
- Challenge: Keeping Azure costs manageable during development and testing
- Approach: Automated resource lifecycle management and pay-per-use strategies

## Next Steps (Day 2 Planning)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Terraform Infrastructure**: Create base infrastructure templates for resource groups and networking
2. **GitHub Actions Setup**: Implement initial CI/CD workflows for infrastructure validation
3. **Azure Monitor Configuration**: Set up basic monitoring and alerting for infrastructure health

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create Terraform modules for Azure resource group and VNet setup
- [ ] Develop GitHub Actions workflow for Terraform validation and deployment
- [ ] Configure Azure service principal for automated deployments
- [ ] Set up Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- [ ] Create initial monitoring dashboard templates

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Add implementation guides to `docs/` folder
- [ ] Create Terraform module documentation
- [ ] Document Azure service principal setup process
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides for common deployment issues
