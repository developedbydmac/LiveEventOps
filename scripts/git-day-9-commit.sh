- **Secret Handling**: Secure passing of secrets between workflow steps with minimal exposure
- **Access Validation**: Built-in verification of Key Vault access and permissions

## 🛡️ Major Technical and Process Choices

### Security Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Azure Key Vault as Primary Secret Store
**Decision**: Implement Azure Key Vault for all sensitive configuration data
**Justification**: 
- Enterprise-grade security with HSM backing options
- Native Azure integration and compliance certifications
- Audit trail and access logging capabilities
- Cost-effective for secret management at scale

**Implementation Details**:
```terraform
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "liveeventops" {
  name                = "${var.project_name}-kv-${random_string.resource_suffix.result}"
  sku_name            = "standard"
  soft_delete_retention_days = var.key_vault_soft_delete_retention_days
  purge_protection_enabled   = var.key_vault_purge_protection_enabled
  
  network_acls {
    default_action = var.key_vault_network_default_action
    bypass         = "AzureServices"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Service Principal Authentication Model
**Decision**: Replace JSON credential files with individual service principal components
**Justification**:
- Reduced attack surface through granular secret management
- Better integration with Azure RBAC and Key Vault
- Simplified credential rotation procedures
- Enhanced audit capabilities

**Migration Path**:
```yaml
# Old approach
- name: Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

# New approach
- name: Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
```

#### 3. Hybrid Secret Management Strategy
**Decision**: Implement Key Vault with GitHub Secrets fallback
**Justification**:
- Enables gradual migration without service disruption
- Provides resilience during initial deployments
- Maintains backwards compatibility during transition
- Reduces deployment complexity

**Implementation Logic**:
```bash
KV_NAME=$(az keyvault list --resource-group "$RG" --query "[?starts_with(name, 'liveeventops-kv')].name" -o tsv | head -1)

if [ -n "$KV_NAME" ]; then
  # Use Key Vault secrets
  SSH_KEY=$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name "$KV_NAME" --name "ssh-public-key" --query "value" -o tsv)
else
  # Fallback to GitHub secrets
  SSH_KEY="${{ secrets.SSH_PUBLIC_KEY }}"
fi
```

### Security Controls and Compliance

#### 1. Access Policy Framework
**Principle**: Implement least privilege access with role-based permissions
**Implementation**:
- Terraform service principal: Full secret management capabilities
- Application service principals: Read-only access to specific secrets
- Human users: Administrative access with MFA requirements
- Configurable additional access policies for team scaling

#### 2. Secret Lifecycle Management
**Approach**: Automated secret rotation with versioning and backup
**Features**:
- Soft delete protection with configurable retention (7-90 days)
- Optional purge protection for production environments
- Automatic secret versioning for rollback capabilities
- Migration and rotation scripts for operational management

#### 3. Network Security Controls
**Strategy**: Configurable network access with production hardening
**Configuration**:
```hcl
variable "key_vault_network_default_action" {
  description = "Default network access (Allow/Deny)"
  type        = string
  default     = "Allow"  # Set to "Deny" for production
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["Allow", "Deny"], var.key_vault_network_default_action)
    error_message = "Key Vault network default action must be either 'Allow' or 'Deny'."
  }
}
```

## 💪 Struggles and Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: GitHub Actions Secret Context Limitations
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow validation flagged Key Vault secret references as potentially invalid
**Root Cause**: Static analysis couldn't validate dynamic secret retrieval from Key Vault
**Solution**: Implemented robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
**Learning**: Dynamic secret management requires careful error handling and validation

### Challenge 2: Terraform Backend Chicken-and-Egg Problem
**Problem**: Key Vault needed for secret storage, but Terraform backend configuration required secrets
**Root Cause**: Circular dependency between infrastructure provisioning and secret management
**Solution**: Hybrid approach with GitHub Secrets for initial deployment, Key Vault for ongoing operations
**Impact**: Added complexity but improved long-term security posture

### Challenge 3: Service Principal Permission Scoping
**Problem**: Determining minimal required permissions for Terraform service principal
**Root Cause**: Azure Key Vault requires specific permission combinations for different operations
**Solution**: Implemented granular permission sets based on operation requirements
**Outcome**: Achieved principle of least privilege while maintaining full functionality

### Challenge 4: Cross-Environment Secret Management
**Problem**: Managing secrets across development, staging, and production environments
**Approach**: Single Key Vault with environment-specific access policies and secret naming conventions
**Considerations**: Future enhancement could implement per-environment Key Vaults for additional isolation

## 🚀 Technical Implementation Highlights

### Terraform Security Enhancements
```hcl
# Key Vault with security controls
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "liveeventops" {
  name                = "${var.project_name}-kv-${random_string.resource_suffix.result}"
  soft_delete_retention_days = var.key_vault_soft_delete_retention_days
  purge_protection_enabled   = var.key_vault_purge_protection_enabled
  
  # Security-focused network controls
  network_acls {
    default_action = var.key_vault_network_default_action
    bypass         = "AzureServices"
  }
}

# Configurable additional access policies
resource "azurerm_key_vault_access_policy" "additional" {
  count = length(var.additional_key_vault_access_policies)
  
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.liveeventops.id
  tenant_id    = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id
  object_id    = var.additional_key_vault_access_policies[count.index].object_id
  
  secret_permissions      = var.additional_key_vault_access_policies[count.index].secret_permissions
  key_permissions        = var.additional_key_vault_access_policies[count.index].key_permissions
  certificate_permissions = var.additional_key_vault_access_policies[count.index].certificate_permissions
}
```

### GitHub Actions Security Integration
```yaml
- name: Get Key Vault secrets
  id: keyvault
  run: |
    KV_NAME=$(az keyvault list --resource-group ${{ secrets.TF_STATE_RESOURCE_GROUP }} --query "[?starts_with(name, 'liveeventops-kv')].name" -o tsv | head -1)
    
    if [ -n "$KV_NAME" ]; then
      SSH_KEY=$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name "$KV_NAME" --name "ssh-public-key" --query "value" -o tsv 2>/dev/null || echo "")
      echo "ssh-key=${SSH_KEY:-${{ secrets.SSH_PUBLIC_KEY }}}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "ssh-key=${{ secrets.SSH_PUBLIC_KEY }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
```
