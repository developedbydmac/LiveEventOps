# LiveEventOps

A comprehensive platform for automating live event IT infrastructure deployment and management using Azure cloud services, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

LiveEventOps addresses the complex challenges of deploying and managing IT infrastructure for live events by leveraging cloud automation, infrastructure as code, and modern DevOps practices to deliver reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.

## The Challenge: Manual Event IT Setup

### Current Pain Points

Live events require sophisticated IT infrastructure that traditionally involves manual setup processes fraught with challenges:

#### **Access Points (APs) and Networking**
- **Manual Configuration**: Each access point requires individual configuration for SSID, security protocols, and network segmentation
- **Coverage Planning**: Requires physical site surveys and manual heat mapping to ensure optimal wireless coverage
- **Interference Management**: Manual frequency planning and channel assignment to avoid conflicts
- **Scalability Issues**: Adding new APs during events requires on-site technical intervention

#### **Camera Systems and Video Infrastructure**
- **Complex Cabling**: Manual routing of video cables, power, and network connections across event venues
- **Encoding Setup**: Individual configuration of video encoders, streaming parameters, and quality settings
- **Recording Management**: Manual storage allocation, backup configuration, and content organization
- **Live Streaming**: Real-time monitoring and adjustment of streaming quality and redundancy paths

#### **Power over Ethernet (PoE) Deployment**
- **Power Budget Calculations**: Manual assessment of power requirements for cameras, APs, and other devices
- **Switch Configuration**: Individual VLAN setup, port configuration, and power allocation
- **Cable Management**: Physical organization and documentation of network infrastructure
- **Troubleshooting**: On-site diagnosis of power delivery issues and network connectivity problems

#### **Printer and Peripheral Management**
- **Driver Installation**: Manual setup of print drivers and queue configurations
- **Network Integration**: Individual printer network configuration and security setup
- **Consumables Management**: Manual monitoring of ink, paper, and maintenance requirements
- **User Access Control**: Manual assignment of printing permissions and usage tracking

### Operational Challenges

- **Time-Intensive Setup**: Events can take days or weeks to fully configure IT infrastructure
- **Human Error Risk**: Manual processes are prone to configuration mistakes and oversight
- **Documentation Gaps**: Inconsistent documentation leads to knowledge silos and troubleshooting delays
- **Resource Allocation**: Requires specialized technical staff on-site throughout event duration
- **Cost Escalation**: Manual processes drive up labor costs and increase risk of expensive mistakes
